# teenprojects



So welcome to the main repo for all of our work! 
This repo is very empty so we need some ideas. If you have ideas you should post them on the [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenProjects/comments/3bes55/organising_a_programming_project_for_teen/) and see the response from the community. A couple of things to consider before starting on a project:

- Languages?
- Platforms?
- Coding style (camelCase, hungarian notation, etcâ€¦)
- Algorithm design (I know as much as anybody the urge to jump in and code, but with good design it is much more likely to be successful and efficient)
- potential skill requirement

Just a quick blurb I thought I would write for y'all. Happy coding!
